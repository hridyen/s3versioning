# ðŸª£ S3 Bucket Versioning - Simple Project

This repository demonstrates how to enable and test Versioning in an Amazon S3 Bucket.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Versioning?

S3 Versioning allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in a bucket. Once enabled, even deletes or overwrites do not permanently remove the data 
they just create new versions.

---

## âœ… Steps Performed

1. **Created an S3 Bucket**
2. **Enabled Versioning** in the bucket properties
3. **Uploaded multiple versions** of the same object (by uploading a file with the same name)
4. **Viewed object versions** from the "Versions" tab in the bucket
5. **Deleted a version** and observed that the object is not truly gone just marked with a delete marker
6. **Restored previous versions** as needed

---

## ðŸ”Ž Use Case

This feature is useful when:
- You want to protect against accidental overwrites or deletions
- You need to audit changes or roll back to a previous state
- You're storing critical documents or media
